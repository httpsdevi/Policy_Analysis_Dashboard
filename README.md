## 🐍 Python Backend Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
```python
# Key Python Libraries Used
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computations
- scikit-learn: Machine learning models
- matplotlib/seaborn: Statistical visualizations
- warnings: Clean output handling
```

### Machine Learning Models Implemented

1. **Lapse Risk Prediction Model**
   - **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting Classifier
   - **Accuracy:** 94.3%
   - **Features:** 12 key variables including demographics, payment history, claims ratio
   - **Output:** Probability of policy lapse within next 12 months

2. **Risk Scoring Algorithm**
   - **Method:** Weighted composite scoring
   - **Factors:** Age risk, payment delays, claims history, customer satisfaction, policy tenure
   - **Scale:** 0-10 (normalized risk score)
   - **Categories:** Low (0-4), Medium (4-7), High (7-10)

### Data Export for Tableau
```csv
# Key Fields in policy_data_for_tableau.csv
- policy_id: Unique identifier
- demographic_data: Age, gender, region, employment
- financial_metrics: Premium amount, coverage, claims ratio
- risk_indicators: Lapse risk score, probability, category
- calculated_fields: Customer lifetime value, risk-adjusted premium
```

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard Architecture

### Dashboard Structure

#### 1. Executive Summary Page
- **KPI Cards:** Total premium volume, retention rate, average risk score
- **Trend Analysis:** Monthly premium growth with AI predictions
- **Regional Heatmap:** Performance by geography and demographics
- **Risk Distribution:** Portfolio segmentation by risk categories

#### 2. Risk Analysis Deep Dive
- **Scatter Plot:** Premium vs Risk Score (colored by age)
- **Drill-down Table:** High-risk policies requiring immediate action
- **Predictive Analytics:** ML model outputs and confidence intervals
- **Action Dashboard:** Recommended interventions for policy retention

#### 3. Demographic Segmentation
- **Age Group Analysis:** Premium distribution and lapse rates
- **Regional Performance:** Comparative analysis across territories
- **Customer Profiling:** Behavioral patterns and preferences
- **Market Opportunity:** Growth segments and expansion targets

### Tableau Features Implemented

#### Interactive Elements
- **Parameter Controls:** Dynamic date ranges and filtering
- **Quick Filters:** Policy type, region, risk category selection
- **Highlight Actions:** Cross-dashboard filtering and highlighting
- **Drill-down Capabilities:** Summary to detail navigation

#### Advanced Analytics
- **Calculated Fields:**
  ```tableau
  Risk-Adjusted Premium = [Premium Amount] * (1 + [Risk Score]/10)
  Customer Lifetime Value = [Premium Amount] * [Years Active] * (1 - [Lapse Probability])
  Retention Rate = 1 - AVG([Will Lapse])
  ```

- **Level of Detail Expressions:**
  ```tableau
  Regional Average = {FIXED [Region] : AVG([Premium Amount])}
  Policy Count by Risk = {FIXED [Risk Category] : COUNT([Policy ID])}
  ```

#### Data Connections
- **Primary Source:** policy_data_for_tableau.csv
- **Refresh Schedule:** Daily automated refresh
- **Data Quality:** Built-in validation rules and error handling
